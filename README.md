# <Calendar>

## Description

This is the Module 5 project. It uses node.js to create a usable calendar for users.

## Installation

I created a repository through Git Hub. After that, I went into Gitbash to create all the necessary files for the project, JS, CSS, and HTML. moving forward I copied the starter code and downloaded node.js a long side of day.js. after all the setup was complete I added more time slots and html and got to work on my JavaScript making sure my JS had a local storage to keep notes and allowed for it to show the current date.

## Usage

The usage of this site is for users to have a Calander that can keep a schedule of what they must do throughout the day and gives them an accurate date.
